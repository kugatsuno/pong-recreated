# pong-recreated

## Introduction

The classic game, Pong, recreated using LUA with LÖVE. 

This personal project utilises game design knowledge such as axis-aligned bounding box hit detection, as well as the ability to code an AI bot where its difficulty can be modified, to play the game with you.

## Instructions

Simply download the repository to your system, and launch the game with LÖVE. 

Ensure all sound and sprite files are kept as is so that they can be rendered correctly in game.
